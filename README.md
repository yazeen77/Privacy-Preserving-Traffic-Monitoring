# Privacy-Preserving-Traffic-Monitoring
This project is a Flask-based web application that collects, processes, and visualizes real-time traffic data while ensuring privacy using geo-indistinguishability techniques. The system utilizes OpenStreetMap (OSM) with a heatmap for traffic visualization and applies machine learning to predict congestion patterns.
